An entrepreneur, software engineer, church pianist, and aspiring data scientist, I utilize my skills serving college students and faculty by day, and small businesses and Christian ministries needing websites and web applications by night. When not sitting in front of a computer, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading, hiking, traveling, and watching movies. I, with my two sisters, was homeschooled from birth to graduation from high school. I believe that the best education is that received while living life â€“ not in a class room.', 'assets/robby-mccullough-1343350-unsplash.jpg'),
